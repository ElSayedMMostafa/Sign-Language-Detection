To project runs on OpenCV4.
The folder contains three folders, the code and a report:
Three folders:
1. Demos that contains the video used in the code notebook, more demos that we created to evaluate the project are found here https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HT5CtAmaSQ-DO7ckghQRdNHagMaHJ8cN?usp=sharing
2. Models that contain the model we used for the classification, more created models here https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aQcG5dZtGnIVp2Gt40DUS7rKdB23SZWk
3. The results, that contains our most performing result.
4. Image_samples containing samples of training dataset
The code:
helpers.py: containing the segementation function
main.ipynb: containing the main project to be run
2 model notebooks showing the process of creation of the aforementioned models
